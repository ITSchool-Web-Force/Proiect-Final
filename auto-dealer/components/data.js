Inspired by the Super Sport, numerous changes were made to the front and rear of the Grand Sport Vitesse to optimise the aerodynamics. Larger air vents were added to the front while the rear features a double diffuser and central dual exhaust just like the Super Sport.

      "Senna. A name that sends shivers to one's spine for any motorsport fan. This is because Aryton Senna is widely regarded as one of the greatest Formula One drivers of all time having won 3 world championships for the McLaren F1 team from the late 80's to early 90s. Fast forward 17 years and McLaren have paid tribute to this incredible Brazilian racing driver by creating the most extreme McLaren road car ever built. This is not just a marketing exercise for McLaren as they have fastidiously designed the car from the aerodynamics to the chassis and powertrain and worked closely with Ayrton's nephew Bruno Senna to develop the car as well as the Senna Foundation in order to use the name.",

The easily distinguishable Vantage shape has been accentuated by aero sections to improve airflow around the car. The front fenders are where you will find a beautiful carbon fibre element that continues along the lower side of the car. To the rear, the diffuser has undergone a total redesign featuring a centre exit exhaust. To keep the twin-turbo V12 cool, Aston Martin has graced the run-out Vantage with a 25% larger grille in the front bumper with a beautifully sculpted carbon fibre bonnet with integrated vent to aid cooling. The overall track of the car has been widened contributing to the overall more aggressive styling where new 21” wheels sit.",

The structure is claimed to be the most rigid that Maserati have put into production, bettering that of the legendary MC12. Taking advantage of the lightweight chassis, the all new Formula 1 dervied 3.0L twin-turbo V6 engine mounted behind the driver accelerates the MC20 from 0-62mph in only 2.9 seconds with a top speed of 202mph. This means that there is plenty of power and torque to go around, producing 621bhp and 730Nm respectively. Figures like this in such a compact, lightweight chassis makes exploring all 8000 RPM an addictive and exhilarating experience.",
